# Main HTML Project - Brainnest

This repository contains the first project I completed as part of my education at Brainnest. Brainnest is a company that specializes in providing education to aspiring front-end developers, helping students improve their skillset and industry knowledge. The program encourages team learning and collaboration for a well-rounded learning experience.
